<br>

**mangoRadio** is a lightweight FiveM script that adds an interactive radio system using an item-based context menu. It integrates seamlessly with pma-voice, allowing players to set their radio channel and volume, with settings saved locally and restored automatically after reconnects or script restarts. Private channels can be restricted to specific jobs like police or EMS, with access verified on join. Visual animations and notifications provide clear feedback when connecting, switching channels, or losing access.
